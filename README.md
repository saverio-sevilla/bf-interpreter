# Simple Brainfuck interpreter

Simple Brainfuck interpreter, the 'compile' function compiles the source code into an array of tokens. The array of tokens is then interpreted 
by the 'execute' function. The '[' and ']' operators are translated into jumps using a simple stack-based algorithm. 

To execute a program just specify the path in bf_interpreter.c
